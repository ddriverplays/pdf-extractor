Concurrent PDF OCR Extractor

A robust Python script that extracts text from PDF files by converting pages to high-DPI images and performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract. This tool uses concurrent processing for speed and supports resuming interrupted jobs.

🌟 Features

Concurrent Processing: Utilizes multiple CPU cores to process pages simultaneously.

High Accuracy: Renders PDF pages to high-resolution PNGs (default 300 DPI) for improved OCR results.

Resume Capability: Automatically detects partial output and allows the user to resume processing from the last successfully completed page.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Supports easy configuration via command-line arguments.

Output Consolidation: Merges all successfully extracted text into a single combined_output.txt file.

📋 Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your system before running the script:

1. Python 3

The script requires Python 3.8 or newer.

2. Tesseract OCR Engine

Tesseract is the core OCR engine used by the script.

Installation: Install Tesseract via your system's package manager.

macOS (using Homebrew): brew install tesseract

Linux (using apt): sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

Windows: Download the installer from the Tesseract GitHub. You will need to note the installation path for the --tesseract-path argument later.

Language Packs: If you need to process languages other than English (eng), you must install the corresponding Tesseract language packs (e.g., tesseract-ocr-fra for French, tesseract-ocr-deu for German).

3. Required Python Libraries

The script relies on PyMuPDF (for PDF rendering) and Pillow/pytesseract (for OCR).

🚀 Installation & Setup

A. Clone the Repository

Assuming your script is named pdf_extractor.py, navigate to the directory where you saved it.

B. Setup Python Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

# 1. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (CMD)
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


C. Install Dependencies

You will need the following libraries. If you are using the provided install.sh script, this step is handled automatically.

pip install PyMuPDF pytesseract Pillow


⚙️ Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run the simple installation script to check for Python dependencies.

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh


💻 Usage

The script can be run using a single required argument (the PDF path) and several optional arguments.

Basic Execution

Run the script, providing the path to your PDF file:

python pdf_extractor.py path/to/your/document.pdf


Upon execution, the script will:

Check for previous progress.

Prompt you to choose to process all pages, resume from the last page, or select a specific range.

Example: Resume an Interrupted Job

If you stopped processing a 100-page document at page 50, rerunning the command will let you resume:

python pdf_extractor.py my_long_report.pdf

# Output will prompt:
# Found existing files. Last successfully processed page was 50 of 100.
# Enter 'r' to resume at page 51, 'a' for all, 'n' for a new range, or 'q' to quit: r


Advanced Arguments

You can override the default configuration using the following flags:

Argument

Default

Description

[PDF_PATH]

N/A

Required. Path to the input PDF file.

--output-dir

.

The base directory where the processing folder will be created.

--dpi

300

Rendering quality (DPI). Higher values lead to better OCR but slower processing.

--lang

eng

Tesseract language code(s). Use + to combine (e.g., eng+deu).

--tesseract-path

/usr/bin/tesseract

Full path to the Tesseract executable. Crucial for Windows/non-standard installs.

Command Examples

1. Process a range with high quality (600 DPI) using English and French:

First, start the script. When prompted, enter the range (n or 1-50):

python pdf_extractor.py thesis.pdf --dpi 600 --lang eng+fra

# (When prompted)
# Enter 'a' for all pages, 'r' for a range (e.g., 5-10), or 'q' to quit: 1-50


2. Specify the Tesseract path for a Windows installation:

python pdf_extractor.py my_doc.pdf --tesseract-path "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"


📦 Output Structure

A new directory named <pdf_name>_processed will be created inside your chosen output directory.

<pdf_name>_processed/
├── combined_output.txt      # The final merged text document.
├── png_images/
│   ├── 0001.png
│   ├── 0002.png
│   └── ...
└── text_files/
    ├── 0001.txt             # Text output for page 1.
    ├── 0002.txt             # Text output for page 2.
    └── ...


Note: If a page fails OCR, its corresponding .txt file will contain an OCR FAILED marker along with the error message. Failed pages are automatically skipped during the consolidation into combined_output.txt.
